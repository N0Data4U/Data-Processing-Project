# Data-Processing-Project

This final project is part of the Data Processing in Python (JEM207) course at IES.
This project is about scraping, procesing and, analysis mobile phone data, utilizing the python programming language.
Precisely, we scrape data from three Czech online retailers using the BeautifulSoup library. During the data processing 
stage we try to transform data from multiple sources into a uniform format. Finally, multiple phone characteristics are 
used to draw coclusions about the phone prices.
