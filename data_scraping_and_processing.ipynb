    "1) Creating a function to save all necessary data for one product simultaneously.\n",
    "2) Create a function to let the function from 1) run over all product URL's.\n",
    "2) (How to save the data of the product description -> we need to look at different products and see what variables we can define.)\n",
    "3) How to work with github, commits, pull etc.?\n",
    "4) How to create a nice table in github to document aims and checkpoints.\n",
    "5) How to structure the repository -> documents for functions, loading packages, ReadMe etc.\n",
    "6) Running scripts on christmas again, to see if their is a price drop because of price offers\n",
    "7) Starting data analysis -> simple averages, counts etc. -> can we create a dashboard on github? (Share or products etc.)\n",
    "8) Further Statistical Analysis - Ideas:\n",
    "    1) Predicing prices for new products (price modelling), finding out which variables drive prices the most (factor)-> Does it makes sense to do a price model as prices consist largely of the purchase price; could we find those purchase prices somewhere and join them with our data?\n",
    "    2) Brand Analysis: Explore the average prices of smartphones for each brand. Analyze market share based on the number of products or total sales for each brand.\n",
    "    3) Storage Impact: Investigate how storage capacity (GB) affects smartphone prices. Explore the most popular storage capacity among consumers.\n",
    "    4) Segment the market based on different characteristics (e.g., high-end, mid-range, budget). One could then do 1) on all different segments to explore differences.\n",
    "    5) Consumer Preferences: Survey or analyze customer reviews to understand what features users value the most. Identify common positive and negative sentiments related to smartphone characteristics.\n",
    "    6) Profitability Analysis (given that we know production or purchase prices): Estimate profit margins for different smartphones based on their production costs and prices.\n",
    "Identify the most profitable products in your dataset. One could use the number of ratings as a proxy for the number of sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Which data tests and checks can we include?"
